About
=====

Mini Script (GMS) is a filter plugin.

In order to use it, you need Geany 0.15 or later.

Features
========
This plugin is a tool to apply a script filter on ::

   o the text selection,
   o the current document,
   o all documents of the current session.

The filter type can be ::

   o Unix shell script,
   o Perl script,
   o Python script,
   o sed commands,
   o AWK script.

The output can be ::

   o the selection of the current document,
   o all the current document,
   o or a new document.

Requirements
============

For compiling GMS you need Geany, GTK2 includes, and the GTK2 library.

Furthermore, you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; the
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.

Usage
=====

After compiling and/or installing GMS, start Geany and go to menu
Tools -> Plugin Manager and set the checkbox at the "Mini Script" plugin.

Open the Mini Script window by menu Tools -> "Mini Script".

In the combobox box (default value "Shell"), you have the following options::

    o Shell path,
    o Perl path,
    o Python path,
    o sed path,
    o AWK path, and
    o user script.

In the Mini Script window you have the following options ::

    o With the combobox, you select the script type,
    o In the text view, you write the filter script.
    o In the input area, you select the filter input::
           * current selection
           * current document
           * all the session documents
    o In the output area, you select the filter output::
           * current document
           * new document
    o and you click on the apply button.

Ideas, questions, patches and bug reports
=========================================

If you add something, or fix a bug, please send a patch (in 'diff -u'

Coding
======

Use static functions where possible.
Try to use GLib types and functions - e.g. g_free instead of free and
try to use only GLib 2.6 and GTK 2.6 functions. At least for the moment,
we want to keep the minimum requirement for GTK at 2.6.
